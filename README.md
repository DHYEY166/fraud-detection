# Financial Transaction Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project implements various machine learning models to detect fraudulent financial transactions using a synthetic dataset that mimics real-world transaction patterns. The models include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and LightGBM, with comprehensive feature engineering and model evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset is a synthetic financial transaction dataset designed to simulate realistic patterns across multiple categories including retail, grocery, dining, travel, and more. Due to its large size, the dataset is not included in this repository but can be accessed at:
- [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ismetsemedov/transactions/data)

### Key Features
- Transaction details (amount, timestamp, merchant category)
- Geographic information (country, city, city size)
- Payment method details (card type, card presence)
- Device and channel information
- Velocity metrics (transaction patterns in the last hour)
- Fraud labels for supervised learning
